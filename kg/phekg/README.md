The PheKG knowledge graph builds upon multiple publicaly available resources, including 
the PheMap knowledgebase and the phecode coding system. We provide short descriptions and
citations of these resources below:

Modifications:
To reduce the file size of PheMap_Mapped_Terminologies_1.1.csv, we removed all rows containing
ICD10CM codes and provided this filtered version as PheMap_Mapped_Terminologies_1.1_filtered.csv
